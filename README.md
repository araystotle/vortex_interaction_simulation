# Fluid Mechanics: Vortex Interaction
This is a MATLAB fluid dynamics project that visually simulates the interaction of vortices.

The potential flow theory of fluid dynamics was applied to solve the governing equations of fluid flow. In particular, the interaction of fluid vortices was analyzed and computed visually by the use of MATLAB software.
